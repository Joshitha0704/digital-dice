## 🔧 Apparatus Required

### **Hardware**

* Arduino Board
* Breadboard & Jumper Wires
* 7 LEDs (6 for dice numbers + 1 for rolling animation)
* 7 Current-limiting resistors (220–330Ω)
* Push-button switch
* Pull-down resistor (10kΩ)
* Power source (USB cable & computer)

### **Software**

* Programming language: **C++ (Arduino IDE)**

## 🛠️ Procedure

1. **Plan the Circuit** – Connect 6 LEDs to Arduino (one per dice face).
2. **Connect LEDs** – Insert LEDs & resistors into the breadboard.
3. **Write Code** – Program Arduino to generate random numbers (1–6).
4. **Test the Dice** – Upload code; LEDs display random dice results.
5. **Add Button** – Push-button triggers the dice roll.
